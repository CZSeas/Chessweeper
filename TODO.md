How it works:  
- Chess but 8 (maybe less) hidden mines set on each side at start of game
- Each piece indicates how many mines are adjacent to it
- Hovering over a piece shows this number
- Landing a piece on an opponent's mine blows up the piece and all adjacent pieces
- You can protect your mines by placing your own pieces on top of them
- You can flag squares where you think mines are

Misc ideas:  
- Capturing opponents pieces gives an equivalent amount of gold
- Gold can be spent to buy Abilities

Abilities:  
- Move pawn 2 squares forward
- Swap king and queen
- Let piece move into one of your rooks.
If the rook is captured while a piece is inside, both pieces are lost
(Undecided): the rook may not move when a piece is inside/any move kicks the piece out
If a king is inside a rook, any piece targeting a rook counts as a check
- Fog of war for one full turn. Fog is broken by checks
- Block an empty square for a turn
- Convert an enemy piece adjacent to your bishop and take control of it for one turn
- Knight dismounts into pawn
- Sacrifice one of your pieces
